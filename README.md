# Spotflow Wallet — Pay-In & Payout Backend

A Spring Boot service that automates wallet funding (Pay-In) and cash withdrawals
(Payout) for a tournament app, integrated with the Spotflow API.

## Stack

- Java 17, Spring Boot 4.1
- PostgreSQL + Flyway migrations
- `RestClient` for outbound Spotflow calls (no external HTTP SDK)

## Where to put your Spotflow API key

**Never put the real key in `application.properties` or commit it to git.**

Set it as an environment variable before starting the app:

```bash
export SPOTFLOW_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_real_key_here
export SPOTFLOW_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_webhook_signing_secret
```

`application.properties` reads it automatically via:
```properties
spotflow.secret-key=${SPOTFLOW_SECRET_KEY:dummy-key}
```

Set `spotflow.mock=true` in your local config for development — **no real key is required** — every endpoint runs fully against an in-memory `MockSpotflowClient`, so the full flow can be exercised before sandbox credentials are ready. When switching to real mode (`spotflow.mock=false`), a valid `SPOTFLOW_SECRET_KEY` is required.

## Running locally

1. Create a local Postgres database:
   ```bash
   createdb wallet_db
   ```
2. Set datasource credentials in `application.properties` if they differ from the
   defaults (`postgres` / no password / `localhost:5432`).
3. Run the app — Flyway will create the schema and seed one test user + wallet
   automatically:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Import `postman/spotflow-wallet.postman_collection.json` (and the accompanying
   environment) into Postman and hit the endpoints. The seeded test user has
   `id=1` and a starting wallet balance of 5000.00 NGN (for testing withdrawals
   without needing a webhook first).

```

The `spotflow` package is the only place that knows about Spotflow's URLs, auth
header format, or payload shapes. `WalletService` and `WebhookService` depend only
on the `SpotflowClient` interface and its DTOs — swapping the mock for the real
client (or pointing at a different provider entirely) never touches business logic.

## Endpoints

### `POST /wallet/fund`
Creates a PENDING transaction, then calls Spotflow's Create Dynamic Account API
to generate a temporary virtual account number for the user to pay into.

```json
{ "userId": 1, "amount": 1000.00 }
```

### `POST /wallet/withdraw`
Debits the local wallet balance immediately (so a user can never withdraw more
than they have, even while the disbursement call is in flight), then calls
Spotflow's Single Disbursement API.

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "amount": 500.00,
  "bankAccountNumber": "0123456789",
  "bankCode": "058",
  "accountName": "Test Player"
}
```

### `POST /webhooks/spotflow`
Receives `account_credit_successful` events from Spotflow when a pay-in lands.
Implements the **idempotency gate**: the delivery's `webhook-id` header is
inserted into a `webhook_events` table with a unique constraint *before* any
wallet mutation happens. If the same event is delivered twice (network retry),
the second insert fails on the unique constraint and the handler exits without
crediting the wallet again. A second, independent safety net — a row-level
lock plus a "transaction must still be PENDING" check in `WalletService` —
guards against the rarer case of something racing on the same transaction
reference. See "Webhook security" below for signature verification.

### Background worker: `PendingTransactionReconciliationWorker`
Runs every 10 minutes via `@Scheduled`. Finds transactions stuck `PENDING` for
over 60 minutes, and for withdrawals, calls Spotflow's
`GET /transfers/reference/{reference}` to get the true status:
- `successful` → marks the transaction `SUCCESS`
- `failed` → refunds the wallet (since the local debit happened up-front) and
  marks `FAILED`
- not found / still pending past the window → marks `ABANDONED`

Note: Spotflow's documented API doesn't expose a "check pay-in status by our
reference" endpoint for dynamic accounts (pay-ins are confirmed exclusively via
webhook) — so for stuck `FUNDING` transactions the worker can only apply the
timeout rule and mark them `ABANDONED`, which is communicated honestly in code
comments rather than silently guessed at.

## Webhook security

Spotflow's webhooks follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://standardwebhooks.com/)
spec: each delivery includes a `webhook-id` header (the documented idempotency
key) and an `x-spotflow-signature` header — an HMAC-SHA256 signature computed
over `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw body}`.

`WebhookController` verifies this signature before doing anything else, and
rejects unverified requests with `401`. The signing secret is **separate from
your API secret key** — it's generated when you set your webhook URL in the
Spotflow dashboard under Settings > API Keys. Set it via:

```bash
export SPOTFLOW_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_webhook_signing_secret
```

If it's left unset, verification is skipped with a loud warning in the logs —
fine for local/mock development, but this **must** be set before pointing a
real webhook at this service, otherwise anyone who finds the URL could POST a
fake "successful" payment event and get a wallet credited for free.

Bank code validation via Spotflow's Resolve Bank Account endpoint is recommended before disbursing in production.
